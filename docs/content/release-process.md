## Major / minor release

To cut a major / minor release of Spin, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a release branch, e.g. `v2.0`. With our branch protection rules this is easiest from the Github UI with the [New Branch button here](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/branches).

1. Switch to the release branch locally and update versions (e.g. `2.0.0-pre0` could be `2.0.0`).
   - Bump the version in Spin's `Cargo.toml`
   - Bump the `spin-macro` version to the same in the spin-sdk's [Cargo.toml](../../sdk/rust/Cargo.toml)
   - Run `make build update-cargo-locks` so that `Cargo.lock` and example/test `Cargo.lock` files are updated

   PR these changes to the release branch ensuring that pull request has a base corresponding to the release branch (e.g. `v2.0`).

1. Create a new tag with a `v` and then the version number, e.g. `v2.0.0`. Then, push the tag to the `fermyon/spin` origin repo.

    As an example, via the `git` CLI:

    ```
    # Switch to the release branch
    git checkout v2.0
    git pull

    # Create a GPG-signed and annotated tag
    git tag -s -m "Spin v2.0.0" v2.0.0

    # Push the tag to the remote corresponding to fermyon/spin (here 'origin')
    git push origin v2.0.0
    ```
    
    **NOTE**
    > The Go SDK tag associated with this release (e.g. `sdk/go/v2.0.0`) will be
    > created in the [release action] that has been triggered by the tag push.
    >
    > When the [release action] completes, binary artifacts and checksums will be
    > automatically uploaded to the GitHub release.

1. Switch back to `main` and update the `Cargo.toml` and `templates/Makefile` versions again, this time to e.g. `2.1.0-pre0` if `2.1.0` is the next anticipated release.
   - Run `make build update-cargo-locks` so that `Cargo.lock` and example/test `Cargo.lock` files are updated
   - PR this to `main`
   - See [sips/011-component-versioning.md](sips/011-component-versioning.md)
     for details

Follow the [wrapping up](#wrapping-up) section to finish off the release process. 

## Patch release

To cut a patch release of Spin, you will need to do the following:

1. Backport the commits you wish to include to the release branch you're creating the patch release for. **NOTE** Use the [backport script](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/blob/main/.github/gh-backport.sh) to do so. 

```
$ ./.github/gh-backport.sh <pull-request> <branch-name>
```

1. Switch to the release branch locally and update versions (e.g. `2.0.0` could be `2.0.1`).
   - Bump the version in Spin's `Cargo.toml`
   - Bump the `spin-macro` version to the same in the spin-sdk's [Cargo.toml](../../sdk/rust/Cargo.toml)
   - Run `make build update-cargo-locks` so that `Cargo.lock` and example/test `Cargo.lock` files are updated

   PR these changes to the release branch ensuring that pull request has a base corresponding to the release branch (e.g. `v2.0`).

1. Create a new tag with a `v` and then the version number, e.g. `v2.0.1`. Then, push the tag to the `fermyon/spin` origin repo.

    As an example, via the `git` CLI:

    ```
    # Switch to the release branch
    git checkout v2.0
    git pull

    # Create a GPG-signed and annotated tag
    git tag -s -m "Spin v2.0.1" v2.0.1

    # Push the tag to the remote corresponding to fermyon/spin (here 'origin')
    git push origin v2.0.1
    ```

    **NOTE**
    > The Go SDK tag associated with this release (e.g. `sdk/go/v2.0.0`) will be
    > created in the [release action] that has been triggered by the tag push.
    >
    > When the [release action] completes, binary artifacts and checksums will be
    > automatically uploaded to the GitHub release.

    Follow the [wrapping up](#wrapping-up) section to finish off the release process.

## Release Candidate

To create a release candidate for a major/minor version of Spin, you will need to do the following:

1. Create the release branch if not already created. With our branch protection rules this is easiest from the Github UI with the [New Branch button here](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/branches). 
Otherwise, switch to the branch locally.

1. Update the Spin version with `-rc.N` where `N` is the release candidate number (e.g. `2.0.0-pre0` could be `2.0.0-rc.1`).
   - Bump the version in Spin's `Cargo.toml`
   - Bump the `spin-macro` version to the same in the spin-sdk's [Cargo.toml](../../sdk/rust/Cargo.toml)
   - Run `make build update-cargo-locks` so that `Cargo.lock` and example/test `Cargo.lock` files are updated

   PR these changes to the release branch ensuring that pull request has a base corresponding to the release branch (e.g. `v2.0`).

1. Create a new tag with a `v` and then the version used above, e.g. `v2.0.0-rc.1`. Then, push the tag to the `fermyon/spin` origin repo.

    As an example, via the `git` CLI:

    ```
    # Switch to the release branch
    git checkout v2.0
    git pull

    # Create a GPG-signed and annotated tag
    git tag -s -m "Spin v2.0.0-rc.1" v2.0.0-rc.1

    # Push the tag to the remote corresponding to fermyon/spin (here 'origin')
    git push origin v2.0.0-rc.1
    ```

    **NOTE**
    > The Go SDK tag associated with this release (e.g. `sdk/go/v2.0.0-rc.1`) will be
    > created in the [release action] that has been triggered by the tag push.
    >
    > When the [release action] completes, binary artifacts and checksums will be
    > automatically uploaded to the GitHub release.

    Follow the [wrapping up](#wrapping-up) section to finish off the release process. 

## Wrapping up

1. A Pull Request will be created by `fermybot` containing changes to the templates per the updated SDK version. Once CI completes, approve this PR and merge via a merge commit (rather than squash or rebase).
   
	>This will trigger the `push-templates-tag` job in the [release action], pushing the `spin/templates/v2.0` tag. (Note that this tag may be force-pushed for all patch releases of a given minor release.)

1. Go to the GitHub [tags page](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases),
   edit the release and add the release notes. (This step is optional if a release candidate.)

1. Be sure to include instructions for
   [verifying the signed Spin binary](./sips/012-signing-spin-releases.md). The
   `--certificate-identity` value should match this release, e.g.
   `https://github.com/fermyon/spin/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v2.0.0`.

1. Unless this is a release candidate, create a Pull Request into Fermyon's Hombrew tap
   repository updating the [Spin formula](https://github.com/fermyon/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Formula/spin.rb).
   In the formula, update the version, point to the latest release artifacts, and set their correct sha256 digests.

The release is now complete!
