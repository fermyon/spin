# Cutting a Spin Release

To cut a release of Spin, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a pull request that changes the version number for your new version (e.g. 0.1.0 becomes 0.1.1)
    - `Cargo.toml` is the most important place to make this change
    - Check the docs for hard-coded version strings
1. Merge the PR created in #1 (Such PRs are still required to get approvals, so make sure you get signoff on the PR)
1. Before proceeding, verify that the merge commit on `main` intended to be tagged is green, i.e. CI is successful
1. Create a new tag with a `v` and then the version number (`v0.1.1`)
1. Push the tag up to `main` on GitHub
    - This will trigger a release build
1. Wait for the `release` [action](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/actions/workflows/release.yaml) to complete, and download the binary artifacts that are generated by that action.
1. Generate SHAs of the Windows, Mac (`amd64` and `aarch64`), and Linux (`amd64` and `aarch64`) binaries with `shasum -a 256` or a similar command
1. Go to the GitHub [tags page](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases) and create a release, adding release notes, and uploading the binaries you downloaded above. The SHAs should go in the release notes.

At this point, you can just verify that all things are good.
