	/// Resolve an internet host name to a list of IP addresses.
	///
	/// See the wasi-socket proposal README.md for a comparison with getaddrinfo.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	/// - `name`: The name to look up. IP addresses are not allowed. Unicode domain names are automatically converted
	///     to ASCII using IDNA encoding.
	/// - `address-family`: If provided, limit the results to addresses of this specific address family.
	/// - `include-unavailable`: When set to true, this function will also return addresses of which the runtime
	///   thinks (or knows) can't be connected to at the moment. For example, this will return IPv6 addresses on
	///   systems without an active IPv6 interface. Notes:
	///     - Even when no public IPv6 interfaces are present or active, names like "localhost" can still resolve to an IPv6 address.
	///     - Whatever is "available" or "unavailable" is volatile and can change everytime a network cable is unplugged.
	///
	/// This function never blocks. It either immediately fails or immediately returns successfully with a `resolve-address-stream`
	/// that can be used to (asynchronously) fetch the results.
	///
	/// At the moment, the stream never completes successfully with 0 items. Ie. the first call
	/// to `resolve-next-address` never returns `ok(none)`. This may change in the future.
	///
	/// # Typical errors
	/// - `invalid-argument`:     `name` is a syntactically invalid domain name.
	/// - `invalid-argument`:     `name` is an IP address.
	/// - `not-supported`:        The specified `address-family` is not supported. (EAI_FAMILY)
