### Verifying the Release Signature

After downloading the <version> release of Spin, either via the artifact attached to this release corresponding to your OS/architecture combination or via the [installation method of your choice](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/install#installing-spin), you are ready to verify the release signature.

First, install [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/). This is the tool we'll use to perform signature verification. Then run the following command:

```
cosign verify-blob \
    --signature spin.sig --certificate crt.pem \
    --certificate-identity https://github.com/fermyon/spin/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/<version> \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    --certificate-github-workflow-sha <commit_sha> \
    --certificate-github-workflow-repository fermyon/spin \
    spin
```

If the verification passed, you should see:
```
Verified OK
```
