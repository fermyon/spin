default interface udp-create-socket {

	/// Create a new UDP socket.
	/// 
	/// Similar to `socket(AF_INET or AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP)` in POSIX.
	/// 
	/// This function does not require a network capability handle. This is considered to be safe because
	/// at time of creation, the socket is not bound to any `network` yet. Up to the moment `bind`/`connect` is called,
	/// the socket is effectively an in-memory configuration object, unable to communicate with the outside world.
