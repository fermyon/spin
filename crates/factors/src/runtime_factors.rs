/// let configured_app = factors.configure_app(app, runtime_config)?;

/// let builders = factors.prepare(&configured_app, "component-id")?;
/// // Build the instance state for the factors
/// let data = factors.build_instance_state(builders)?;
/// // Initialize a `wasmtime` store with the instance state
/// let mut store = wasmtime::Store::new(&engine, data);
