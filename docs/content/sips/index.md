A SIP is a Spin Improvement Proposal. It is a design document that describes a
new feature for Spin. It is intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing
major work items in the Spin project, and for documenting the design decisions
that have gone into the project.

Here is a list of accepted SIPs:

- [Spin Deploy](../sips/001-spin-deploy.md)
- [Application Configuration](../sips/002-app-config.md)
- [Trigger Executors](../sips/003-trigger-executors.md)
- [Spin Build](../sips/004-spin-build.md)
- [Application Manifest Redesign](../sips/005-manifest-redesign.md)
- [Spin Plugins](../sips/006-spin-plugins.md)
