## Fake plugin manifests

These plugin manifests are fake - they exist to help exercise compatibility
failure paths.  They are in a compatible layout for you to xcopy to your
catalogue snapshot directory (`~/.local/share/spin/plugins/.spin-plugins/manifests/`).

The actual package pointers are what we engineers call "hot garbage"; they
cannot be installed as actual plugins.
